# Shell Jump Go

## What is it?
A Godot recreation of Shell Jump (https://github.com/Login1990/Shell_Jump), which me and some of my friends made during Finnish Game Jam 2023, with added features and changes.

Shell Jump Go (and the original Shell Jump) is a game inspired by Doodle Jump. In a similar fashion, your objective is to go higher up through platforms (roots) as far as possible. 

What separates this game are the mechanics. In Shell Jump Go, you are a bug attempting to go up through roots and operate by shooting a bug-sized shotgun, which recoils you up with up to 2 shots between roots. This leaves you with control of where your bug ends up and once you fall, you have to start all over again. How high can you go?

The roots are procedurally generated as you go up with random positioning, which provides variety to the gameplay. Further features to enhance gameplay diversity are also planned for the future.

## How to play
Simply point your mouse below you and click. This will shoot you in the opposite direction. While in the air, shoot again to go further up and alter your course. 

The direction of the recoil depends on where you point with your mouse, so position your shot accordingly.
